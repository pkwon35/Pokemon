Contributor:
+ Jun Ki Kwon (Peter)

This repo is my first ever project with **Python** as a language and used it to create graphical visualization to better interpret compared to just tables. 

I have used Pokemon stat data downloaded from kaggle.com


Things I have done:
+ Data cleaning
+ Figured out a code to create scatter plot With different color based on a variable



Things to do:
+ Choose several variables to be compared and come up with a hypothesis
+ use those variable to generate different visualization
+ interpret visualization and come up with conclusion
+ Compare conclusion with hypothesis
